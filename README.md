# Unison Specification

This repo defines the stable contracts for the Unison system.

Scope:
- System architecture and module boundaries.
- Message formats between modules.
- Accessibility and safety requirements.
- Version compatibility between modules.

Any module in the platform must conform to these contracts. CI will block merges if it does not.
